            <p class="blurb"><i lang="fr">Place Saint-Sulpice</i> is surrounded by many interesting curiosities. Here are some of the most intriguing sites to be found around the square.</p>

                    <h2><i lang="fr">Église Saint-Sulpice</i></h2>
                    <p>The Saint-Sulpice Church is massive. Its imposing façade is covered in columns and statues. Inside, every corner of the immense stone interior reveals artistic treasures, from Delacroix’s angel frescoes to a sculpted basin for holy water topped with an enormous clam shell. Masses are celebrated regularly, and the vibrations of the grand organ shake listeners to their bones.</p>

                    <h2><i lang="fr">Fontaine Saint-Sulpice</i></h2>
                    <p>The square's central attraction is an enormous fountain, sumptuously decorated with roaring lions and seated bishops. The holy men's stern faces perhaps indicate their displeasure with the fountain's hidden pun: it is also known as <em>The Fountain of the Four Cardinal Directions</em>, which in French sounds both like <em>cardinal directions</em> and <em>never cardinals</em>. These four bishops never became cardinals.</p>

                    <p><i lang="fr">Café de la Mairie</i> is a local institution. The café is a cozy spot to sip a beverage and nibble on a croissant right on the square, listening to the fountain roaring and watching well-dressed Parisians go about their day. Locals spend hours here reading newspapers with little espressos and having lively conversations with friends over glasses of beer. It is located on the northern side of the square, at the intersection of <i lang="fr">rue des Canettes</i>.</p>

                    <p>The stately building on the square's southwest corner is the <i lang="fr" class="italics">mairie</i>, or city hall, of the 6th arrondissement. This is where couples in the neighborhood get married: in France, couples must have a civil service in their local <i lang="fr" class="italics">mairie</i> before having religious ceremonies. In front of the building, a board publicly displays the names, addresses, and professions of future spouses for ten days before their civil service.</p>

                    <h2>Wallace Fountain</h2>
                    <p>Wallace Fountains can be found throughout the city, and are refreshing spots to fill a water bottle. These beautiful fountains were the dream of Sir Richard Wallace, a francophile Englishman who decided Parisians needed free access to clean drinking water. A sculptor designed these distinctive green fountains surrounded by four caryatids (representing kindness, simplicity, charity, and sobriety). Parisians know spring is on the way when the fountains turn back on in March.</p>

                    <p>Pierre Hermé’s pastries are world-renowned for their inventive flavors and flawless execution. The flagship boutique is discretely located on the northwest corner of the square on <i lang="fr">rue Bonaparte</i>. A delightful experience can be had by selecting a decadent pastry from the shop and eating it on one of the green benches facing the fountain.</p>

                    <h2>Cobblestone Streets</h2>
                    <p>Narrow cobblestone streets dating from the 15th century connect the southern side of the square to the Luxembourg Gardens. Ornate artistic details cover the looming historic façades. These streets have been home to many famous figures over the centuries, both historical (Ernest Hemingway, Man Ray, Roland Barthes, William Faulkner) and literary (d'Artagnan and Athos from <cite>The Three Musketeers</cite>, Marius from <cite><i lang="fr" class="italics">Les Misérables</i></cite>).</p>
